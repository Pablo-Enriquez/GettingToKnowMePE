    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p1>Hi, my major is computer science because I was always fascinated
    </n> with technology and I want to be able to continue to progress with technology as it advances.
    </n>I have a love/hate relationship with coding as I do find it very challenging but figruing out code works
    </n>is satisfying because it isnt easy to just look at code and know what its doing all the time. I often hear
    </n>computer people saying that they think they know everything about computers but they really dont know anything
    </n>about computers. </p1>

    <h1> What I Hope to Learn In The Course</h1>
    <p1>I hope to get more knowledge that I can use in my career in the future. I thought I wanted to do software
    </n>engineering but now I find myself uncertain so I would like to find out what I am truly passionate about.
    </p1>

    <h1>My Favorite Hobbies</h1>
    <p1>I really enjoy doing all types of things whether it be inside or outside. When it comes to being outdoors 
    </n>I like to play sports like soccer or volleyball or even enjoy hikes or going out to bars or sports events.
    </n>When it comes to being indoors I like to play video games, draw, and do puzzles. I would honestly say that my
    </n>favorite past time is hanging out with my girlfriend as it feels peaceful and lets me slip away from reality 
    </n>for a while.
    </p1>

    <h1>Fun Fact</h1>
    <p1>A fun fact about me is that I like to volunteer for my family organization called Friends After High School
    </n>which aims to have different events for people with special needs. Not to long ago we had a Hawaiian themed 
    </n>party and we had our greatest turnout. We have worked hard to get different sponsors that enjoy helping out with
    </n>their services however they can. For example we have a sponsor that allows us to use their hall for the event, a 
    </n>family friend who is a dj who plays the music for the event and we even got a hotdog place to provide us with some 
    </n>food.
